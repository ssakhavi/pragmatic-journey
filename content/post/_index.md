Welcome to "The ML Architect" blog. This blog is authored by [Siavash Sakhavi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/siavashsakhavi/).
The blog has been created to focus on the following areas:

* Machine Learning & Deep Learning Development & Ideas
* Design Patterns and Software Architectures that have been used in ML 
* DevOps for ML (MLOps)
* Interesting ML and Python tools

You can refer to my [first post]({% post_url 2020-04-03-The-Beginning %}) to see what I mean about "ML Architect". 

Although I could have started the blog somewhere else, I decided to start it here on GitHub pages to give it a try. I hope you'll enjoy.
